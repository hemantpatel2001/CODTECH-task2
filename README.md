overview of project 
 project : create  cheack weather site 

 Weather App Functionality:

The task involves building a weather application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input (city name).
It should display weather information such as temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed.
Depending on the weather condition received from the API, appropriate weather icons should be displayed.
HTML Structure:

The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the web page.
It includes sections for displaying weather information, a search box for user input, and elements for showing weather condition icons.
CSS Styling:

The CSS file (style.css) should contain styles for various elements, ensuring the app is visually appealing and responsive.
Ensure styles are applied consistently across different screen sizes.
JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the logic to interact with the API and update the UI.
Implement functionality to fetch weather data using fetch API and process the response.
Handle edge cases such as invalid city names or API errors (e.g., 404 response).
Dynamically update HTML elements with fetched data (temperature, weather description, etc.).
Change weather icons based on different weather conditions using switch statements.
External Dependencies:

The project includes external resources such as Font Awesome for icons (https://kit.fontawesome.com/680eed7644.js).
Steps to Approach the Task
Understand Requirements: Ensure you have a clear understanding of what the task requires. Focus on key functionalities such as fetching data, updating UI elements, and handling errors.

Setup Environment: Ensure you have access to necessary tools (text editor, browser) and dependencies (API key for OpenWeatherMap).

Code Implementation:

Implement HTML structure based on provided snippets.
Write CSS styles to make the app visually appealing and responsive.
Implement JavaScript logic to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
Update UI elements dynamically based on fetched data and handle error cases appropriately.
Testing and Debugging: Test your application with different input scenarios (valid city, invalid city, no input) to ensure it behaves as expected. Use browser developer tools to debug any issues.
